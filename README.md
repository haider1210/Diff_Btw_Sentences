#### Differeces_Between_two_sentences

### Method Definition
```python
def generate_html_comparison(self, sentences1, sentences2):
```
This line defines a method named `generate_html_comparison` that takes three parameters:
- `self`: Refers to the instance of the class (assuming this method is part of a class).
- `sentences1`: The first string containing sentences to compare.
- `sentences2`: The second string containing sentences to compare.

### Importing Required Libraries
The method uses the `difflib` and `re` libraries:
- `difflib`: Provides classes and functions for comparing sequences, including a class to generate HTML differences.
- `re`: The regular expression library used for string manipulation.

### Creating an HtmlDiff Object
```python
differ = difflib.HtmlDiff(tabsize=2, wrapcolumn=40)
```
An instance of `difflib.HtmlDiff` is created with the following parameters:
- `tabsize=2`: Sets the tab size to 2 spaces.
- `wrapcolumn=40`: Sets the column width for wrapping lines to 40 characters.

### Splitting Input Sentences into Lines
```python
sentences1_lines = sentences1.splitlines()
sentences2_lines = sentences2.splitlines()
```
The `splitlines()` method is called on `sentences1` and `sentences2` to split the input strings into lists of lines. This prepares the sentences for comparison.

### Generating the HTML Diff
```python
html_diff = differ.make_file(sentences1_lines, sentences2_lines, context=True, numlines=0)
```
The `make_file` method of `HtmlDiff` is called to generate an HTML file showing the differences between the two lists of lines:
- `sentences1_lines`: The first list of lines.
- `sentences2_lines`: The second list of lines.
- `context=True`: If `True`, generates a contextual diff, showing only the differing parts.
- `numlines=0`: Sets the number of context lines to show around the differences to zero.

### Adding CSS for Word Wrap and Maximum Width
```python
wrapped_html_diff = re.sub(
    r'<style type="text/css">',
    '<style type="text/css"> .diff { white-space: pre-wrap; max-width: 50%; } ',
    html_diff
)
```
A regular expression substitution (`re.sub`) is used to modify the generated HTML to include additional CSS for better display:
- The pattern `r'<style type="text/css">'` matches the beginning of the `<style>` tag in the HTML diff.
- The replacement string `'<style type="text/css"> .diff { white-space: pre-wrap; max-width: 50%; } '` adds CSS rules to the `<style>` section:
  - `white-space: pre-wrap;`: Ensures that whitespace is preserved, but also allows text to wrap onto multiple lines.
  - `max-width: 50%;`: Sets a maximum width of 50% for the diff content, making it easier to view on the page.

### Returning the Modified HTML Diff
```python
return wrapped_html_diff
```
Finally, the method returns the modified HTML diff with the added CSS styling.

### Summary
The `generate_html_comparison` method:
1. Takes two strings of sentences.
2. Splits them into lines.
3. Uses `difflib.HtmlDiff` to generate an HTML file showing the differences.
4. Adds CSS to improve the display of the diff by allowing word wrapping and setting a maximum width.
5. Returns the styled HTML diff.
